# Hosting WordPress on Windows using Nginx with PHP-FPM

This guide outlines the steps to host a WordPress application on a Windows machine using Nginx as the web server, PHP-FPM for running PHP, and automatic startup for PHP-FPM and Nginx after system reboot.

## Prerequisites

- A Windows machine.
- A WordPress application that you want to host.
- Nginx (Web Server).
- PHP 7.x or 8.x (with PHP-FPM).
- NSSM (Non-Sucking Service Manager) to manage PHP-FPM as a service.

## Step 1: Install Nginx on Windows

1. Download Nginx for Windows from the [official Nginx website](https://nginx.org/en/download.html).
2. Extract the Nginx files to a folder (e.g., `C:\nginx`).
3. Open Command Prompt and navigate to the Nginx directory:
    ```bash
    cd C:\nginx
    ```
4. Start Nginx by running:
    ```bash
    start nginx
    ```
5. Verify that Nginx is running by visiting [http://localhost](http://localhost) in your browser.

## Step 2: Install PHP on Windows

1. Download PHP (Thread Safe version) from the [official PHP website](https://windows.php.net/download/).
2. Extract the files to a folder (e.g., `C:\php`).
3. Rename `php.ini-development` to `php.ini` and enable the necessary extensions:
    - Enable cgi by uncommenting: `extension=php_cgi.dll`
    - Enable openssl for HTTPS support: `extension=openssl`
4. Test PHP by running:
    ```bash
    php -v
    ```
    in Command Prompt to check that it is correctly installed.

## Step 3: Install PHP-FPM using NSSM

To keep PHP-FPM running as a service:

1. Download NSSM (Non-Sucking Service Manager) from [nssm.cc](https://nssm.cc/).
2. Extract NSSM to a folder (e.g., `C:\nssm`).
3. In Command Prompt, navigate to the NSSM folder:
    ```bash
    cd C:\nssm\win64
    ```
4. Run the following command to install PHP-FPM as a service:
    ```bash
    .\nssm.exe install PHP-FPM "C:\php\php-cgi.exe" -b 127.0.0.1:9000
    ```
    This command registers PHP-FPM to run as a service on `127.0.0.1:9000`.
5. To start the PHP-FPM service, use:
    ```bash
    .\nssm.exe start PHP-FPM
    ```
6. Verify the PHP-FPM service is running:
    - Open **Services Manager** (`services.msc`), find **PHP-FPM**, and ensure it is set to **Automatic**.

## Steps to Set Up PHP-CGI as a Background Task Using Task Scheduler:
# Create a Task to Run PHP-CGI on Startup:

## Press Windows Key + R, type taskschd.msc, and press Enter to open Task Scheduler.
# In the Actions pane, click Create Task to open the Create Task window.
General Tab:

# Name the task, e.g., "Run PHP-CGI".
Under Security Options, choose Run with highest privileges (this ensures the task runs with administrative rights).
Select Configure for: Windows 10 (or whatever version you're using).
Triggers Tab:

# Click New to add a new trigger.
Set Begin the task to At startup. This ensures that PHP-CGI starts when the machine boots up.
You can also configure other options like Delay task for if necessary, but this is optional.
Actions Tab:

Click New to create a new action.
Set Action to Start a program.
In the Program/script field, browse to php-cgi.exe. This will typically be located in your PHP installation folder, e.g., 
```bash
C:\php\php-cgi.exe.
```
In the Add arguments (optional) field, add the necessary parameters:
css
```bash
 -b 127.0.0.1:9000
```
This starts PHP-CGI and binds it to the specified IP and port.
Conditions Tab:

You can configure conditions here if you want to run the task only when certain conditions are met, like when the machine is idle. However, for a PHP service, itâ€™s usually fine to leave 
this tab empty.
Settings Tab:

Enable Allow task to be run on demand.
Enable If the task fails, restart every X minutes. Set this to 1 minute or a value that fits your needs. This will make sure that PHP-CGI automatically restarts if it crashes.
You can also configure the Stop the task if it runs longer than setting to prevent it from running indefinitely if something goes wrong.
Finish Setup:

Click OK to save the task.
You will be prompted to enter your administrator password if necessary, as you chose to run the task with elevated privileges.
Test the Task:

To test it, you can either restart your computer, or manually run the task from Task Scheduler:
In the Task Scheduler, find your task on the left pane under Task Scheduler Library.
Right-click the task and click Run to see if PHP-CGI starts successfully.

# Steps to Auto-Start Nginx via Task Scheduler

## 1. Open Task Scheduler:
- Press `Win + R`, type `taskschd.msc`, and hit **Enter**.

## 2. Create a Basic Task:
- In the Actions pane, click **Create Basic Task**.
- **Name**: `Start Nginx on Boot`.
- **Description**: (Optional) e.g., "Start Nginx at system startup".

## 3. Set Trigger:
- **Trigger**: Select **When the computer starts** (this ensures Nginx runs even without a user login).

## 4. Define Action:
- **Action**: Choose **Start a program**.
- **Program/script**: Browse to your `nginx.exe` (e.g., `C:\nginx\nginx.exe`).
- **Optional arguments**: Leave this blank unless you need specific flags (e.g., `-c conf\nginx.conf`).
- **Start in (directory)**: Set to your Nginx root folder (e.g., `C:\nginx`).

## 5. Task Scheduler Action Configuration:

### Configure Settings:
- **Run with highest privileges**: Check this to avoid permission issues.

### Under **Conditions** Tab:
- Uncheck **Start the task only if the computer is on AC power** (if applicable).

### Under **Settings** Tab:
- Check **Run task as soon as possible after a scheduled start is missed** (for reliability).

## 6. Finalize:
- Click **Finish** to complete the task setup.

## Step 4: Configure Nginx to Use PHP-FPM

1. Open the Nginx configuration file `nginx.conf` or create a new file (e.g., `wordpress.conf`) in the `C:\nginx\conf\` folder.
2. Add a new server block to handle WordPress requests:
    ```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name localhost;

    root C:/wordpress/lntcmb;
    index index.php index.html index.htm;

    server_tokens off;  # Hide Nginx version

    access_log C:/nginx/logs/access.log;
    error_log C:/nginx/logs/error.log;

    location / {
        try_files $uri $uri/ /index.php?q=$uri&$args;
        index index.php;
    }

    location ~ \.php$ {
        fastcgi_buffers 8 256k;
        fastcgi_buffer_size 128k;
        fastcgi_intercept_errors on;
        include fastcgi_params;
        fastcgi_param SCRIPT_FILENAME $document_root$fastcgi_script_name;
        fastcgi_pass 127.0.0.1:9000;  # Keep this for Windows PHP-FPM
    }

    location ~* \.(ogg|ogv|svg|svgz|eot|otf|woff|mp4|ttf|css|rss|atom|js|jpg|jpeg|gif|png|ico|zip|tgz|gz|rar|bz2|doc|xls|exe|ppt|tar|mid|midi|wav|bmp|rtf)$ {
        expires max;
        log_not_found off;
        access_log off;
    }

    location ~ /\.(?!well-known).* {
        deny all;
    }

    add_header X-Frame-Options "SAMEORIGIN";
    add_header X-XSS-Protection "1; mode=block";
    add_header X-Content-Type-Options "nosniff";

    gzip on;
    gzip_disable "msie6";
    gzip_vary on;
    gzip_proxied any;
    gzip_comp_level 6;
    gzip_min_length 1100;
    gzip_buffers 16 8k;
    gzip_http_version 1.1;
    gzip_types text/plain text/css text/js text/xml text/javascript application/javascript application/x-javascript application/json application/xml application/rss+xml image/svg+xml/javascript;

    client_max_body_size 100M;
}

    ```
Add this is nginx.conf
```bash
#user  nobody;
worker_processes  1;

#error_log  logs/error.log;
#error_log  logs/error.log  notice;
#error_log  logs/error.log  info;

#pid        logs/nginx.pid;

events {
    worker_connections  1024;
}

http {
    include       mime.types;
    default_type  application/octet-stream;
    include C:\\nginx\\conf\\wordpress.conf;  # Use double backslashes here

    sendfile        on;
    keepalive_timeout  65;

    server {
        listen       8080;
        server_name  localhost;

        location / {
            root   html;
            index  index.html index.htm;
        }

        error_page   500 502 503 504  /50x.html;
        location = /50x.html {
            root   html;
        }
    }
}

```
    Replace `C:/path/to/your/wordpress/directory` with the path to your WordPress application.
3. Restart Nginx to apply the changes:
    ```bash
    nssm restart Nginx
    ```

## Step 5: Enable PHP-FPM and Nginx to Start Automatically

1. Open **Services Manager** (`services.msc`).
2. Locate **PHP-FPM** and **Nginx** in the list of services.
3. Right-click on each service and set the **Startup type** to **Automatic**.

## Step 6: Test the Setup

1. Visit [http://localhost](http://localhost) in your browser to check if the WordPress site loads.
2. Verify that PHP-FPM is running on port 9000 using the following command:
    ```bash
    netstat -ano | findstr :9000
    ```
3. If everything is working fine, your WordPress site should be accessible, and PHP should be processed via PHP-FPM.

## Troubleshooting

### Issue 1: 502 Bad Gateway Error
- **Problem**: Nginx cannot connect to PHP-FPM, resulting in a 502 Bad Gateway error.
- 
### Step 1: Install Required Software
We need to install PHP, MySQL, Nginx, and WordPress on your Windows machine.

### 1.1 Install PHP
Download the latest Non-Thread Safe version of PHP from PHP for Windows.

Extract the ZIP file to C:\php.

### Rename php.ini-development to php.ini.

Open php.ini in Notepad and uncomment the following lines by removing ;:

```bash
extension=curl
extension=gd
extension=mbstring
extension=mysqli
extension=openssl
extension=pdo_mysql
extension=mysqli
```
### Add PHP to your system environment variables:

Open Control Panel > System > Advanced System Settings > Environment Variables.
Under "System Variables", find Path, click Edit, and add C:\php.
Test PHP installation:

Open Command Prompt (cmd) and type:
```bash
php -v
```
It should show the installed PHP version.


1.2 Install MySQL
### Download MySQL Community Edition from MySQL Downloads.
Install MySQL with default settings.
Set up a root password and note it down.
Open MySQL command-line client and create a WordPress database:
sql
```bash
CREATE DATABASE wordpress;
CREATE USER 'wp_user'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'yourpassword';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON wordpress.* TO 'wp_user'@'localhost';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```



- **Solution**:
  - Ensure PHP-FPM is running by checking the **Services Manager**.
  - Verify that `fastcgi_pass` in Nginx is pointing to `127.0.0.1:9000` (the correct PHP-FPM port).
  - Restart both Nginx and PHP-FPM.

### Issue 2: PHP-FPM Not Starting
- **Problem**: PHP-FPM doesn't start on boot or stops unexpectedly.
- **Solution**:
  - Use NSSM to ensure PHP-FPM is running as a Windows service and starts automatically:
    ```bash
    .\nssm.exe install PHP-FPM "C:\php\php-cgi.exe" -b 127.0.0.1:9000
    ```
  - Check the **Services Manager** to ensure the PHP-FPM service is running.

### Issue 3: NSSM Not Recognized
- **Problem**: NSSM commands aren't recognized in PowerShell or Command Prompt.
- **Solution**:
  - Make sure NSSM is located in the correct directory.
  - Run the commands from the folder where `nssm.exe` is located (e.g., `C:\nssm\win64`).

### Issue 4: Nginx Not Starting Automatically

Open Command Prompt as Administrator.
Navigate to the folder where nssm.exe is located and run the following command:
This will open a promt UI.
```bash
nssm install Nginx
```
Now add the path where nginx.exe is located and it save.

## After this run command to start nginx.
```bash
net start Nginx
```

## Conclusion

By following the above steps, you have successfully set up WordPress on a Windows machine using Nginx as the web server, with PHP-FPM handling PHP requests. Additionally, Nginx and PHP-FPM have been configured to run automatically after system reboots, ensuring a smooth hosting environment.

This setup allows you to host WordPress on Windows with minimal manual intervention, offering an efficient and automated process.
